# Pebble Ping Pong

The goal of this project is to create a table tennis counter for the pebble watch.

## Plan

The watch shows the score of the current game and the current match. Pressing the upper button increases the current score for the opponent, pressing the lower button increases the own score.

## Planned features

* Display game duration
* Notification when a side switch is due
* Notification when a service alternation is due
* Notification when the match ends, announcing the winner

## Possible future features

* Corresponding Android app that keeps track of matches

## Notes

* The app is designed to have internationalization at compile time

## Changelog

* v0.1 ()
** Initial release
