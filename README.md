# Pebble Ping Pong

The goal of this project is to create a table tennis counter for the pebble watch.

## Description

The watch shows the score of the current game and the current match. Pressing the upper button increases the current score for the opponent, pressing the lower button increases the own score. When a side switch or a service alternation is due the watch vibrates. Short press on the select button pauses and unpauses the game. Long press on the select button starts a new game.
